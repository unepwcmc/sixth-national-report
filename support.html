						<h2>Getting Started</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is the UN Biodiversity Lab?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab is an impartial online mapping tool which connects biodiversity and socioeconomic data with users to support sustainable development planning and decision-making. In particular, the UN Biodiversity Lab supports stakeholder analysis and reporting for the Convention on Biological Diversity’s Aichi Biodiversity Targets. This includes providing data for biodiversity, conservation estates, biodiversity threats, and data related to the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">I’m not part of an organization or government. Can I still access the data?</a>
									<div class="slide">
								  	<p>Yes! The UN Biodiversity Lab is for anyone who is interested in learning more about mapping and sustainable development. Anyone is welcome to create an account and access our global datasets. In addition to a host of open data layers, the platform includes some data layers from third party organisations which may be subject to use restrictions.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">I am a policymaker. How can I access my project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>If you are a policy maker that is involved with the 6th national report to the Convention on Biodiversity Convention, then a project has been automatically created for you. You will need to contact the project administrator to request access.Please contact Christina Supples (Christina.supples@undp.org), Annie Virnig (anne.virnig@undp.org) and Bianca Notarbartolo (Bianca Notarbartolo@un.org) to determine who is administrating your national project.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Why do I need to log-in or create an account?</a>
								<div class="slide">
									<p>Creating an account gives you greater access to the data and analysis features. This includes: a personal data project, the ability to upload and publish data, and the ability to create customized views and dashboards with your data. For policymakers who are developing their Sixth National Reports to the Convention on Biodiversity, registering with MapX is the only way to access their national project. If this applies to you, contact us here:  support@unbiodiversitylab.org.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I create an account?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Simply enter your email into the login and registration screen. A one-time password will be sent to you by email to login. As MapX takes data security very seriously, we do not rely on user passwords that are vulnerable to hacking. Instead, unique passwords will be generated and sent to your email each time you login. If you use the same computer, and depending on your settings, login may be automatic without requesting a new password. Passwords  generated by MapX for each login offer more system security.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Is UN Biodiversity Lab open source?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Yes. The UN Biodiversity Lab data is powered by MapX, an open-source mapping software which collects data from trusted providers. The UN Biodiversity Lab attempts to publish all data with an open license, meaning that you are welcome to explore and share anything you find on the website. However, if data providers have placed certain restrictions on their data sets, some of the functionality of MapX will be reduced for these specific layers (for example, they can be viewed but not downloaded or republished without permission from the original data provider).</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What data does the UN Biodiversity Lab have?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>The UN Biodiversity Lab highlights biodiversity data, conservation estates, threats to biodiversity, and data related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The biodiversity data includes ecological land use, biodiversity hotspots, key biodiversity areas, species distribution and NASA data. Conservations estates include the World Database on Protected Areas and community conserved areas. Threats to biodiversity include the human footprint, mining, and land use changes. SDG  data includes hydrosheds for 3200 cities, poverty, and land tenures. The biodiversity data curated by the UN Biodiversity Lab focuses on helping countries report against five specific Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These include the following:</p>

									<ul>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 5: Halve or bring to zero rate of loss of habitats, significantly reduce degradation and fragmentation.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 11: Conserve 17% of terrestrial and 10% coastal and marine areas, especially important biodiversity areas, important ecosystem services, through effective, equitable, representative well-connected protected areas and other effective area-based measures and integrated into landscapes and seascapes.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 12: Prevent extinctions and improve and sustain species most in decline.</representative>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 14: Restore and safeguard ecosystems that provide essential services – water, health, livelihoods – especially for women, indigenous peoples, local communities, and poor and vulnerable.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">ABT 15: Enhance resilience and contribution of biodiversity to carbon stocks and restore 15% of degraded ecosystems</vulnerable.>
									</ul>

									<p>UN Environment, UNDP and WCMC have identified and curated the best available data layers for each of these targets to enable more streamlined analysis and reporting. The list of available data layers may expand in the future.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What browser works best with the UN Biodiversity Lab?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>With Mac computers or devices running iOS, you may experience bugs when using Chrome or Firefox browsers. We recommend using Safari on Mac computers while we work on fixing this. For Windows, there is no preferred browser - the only requirement is that HTML5 is supported by the browser. Any version of modern browsers including Microsoft Edge, Chrome and Firefox will work well.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I search and filter datasets? </a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Searching and filtering data are essential to help find what you are looking for. From the sidebar menu, you can filter data either globally or by country. You can also filter by keyword, such as biodiversity, conservation, or protected area. Finally, you can filter by type of dataset, such as vector, raster, story map, or dashboard; collection, project themes such as pollution, risk, or ocean analysis; or classes, terms such as environment, stress, or development.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Is the UN Biodiversity Lab interoperable with other geospatial platforms?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Yes. The platform has the capacity to automatically extract and display data from other available geospatial data sets that comply with the Web Map Service (WMS) standard. This will enable users to import various data sets, ranging from socioeconomic and conflict incidence data, to environmentally sensitive areas and occurrence of natural hazards. They will then be able to use these imported layers conduct further analysis and monitoring. MapX can also receive and share data through an API. Contact support@unbiodiversitylab.org for details.</p>

						<h2>Tools and Functions</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is MapX?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>MapX is an open-source, online mapping platform managed by the United Nations to quickly and easily access and create maps using the best available scientific data. MapX acts as a trusted data broker to help people find spatial solutions to environmental and natural resource challenges. MapX aims to increase the engagement of citizens and stakeholders in the management of natural resources and the environment by powering customized applications and websites that increase access to data and offer a simple toolkit for analysis, visualization and sharing.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is the difference between UN Biodiversity Lab and MapX?</a>
								<div class="slide">
									<p>The MapX data catalogue and toolkit powers applications and websites that offer customized geospatial solutions to specific stakeholder needs and processes. The UN Biodiversity Lab is powered by MapX meaning that MapX hosts and displays all geospatial data included in UN Biodiversity Lab, organised in a global data catalogue and complete with visualization and analytical tools. It has been customized and curated to meet the reporting requirements of the 6th national report for the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is the overlap analysis?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>The overlap analysis, also called overlay or coincidence analysis, calculates the amount of overlap between different views. The analysis itself involves selecting a view, and overlapping another view to both visualize and calculate the area where the views overlap. Overlaps can only be conducted with vector views, one of which must be composed of polygons (as opposed to points or lines).</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is the difference between a view and a layer? </a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>When data is uploaded, it becomes a source layer, which will ultimately be replaced and published as a view. Views are created from source layers for display on the map. The reason for this is that source layers can be featured with multiple variables that cannot be displayed on a map all at the same time. Instead, a view is specifically associated to one specific variable from the attribute table of the source layer. Multiple individual views can be created from the same source layer (see below). Views can be selected and displayed on the map, with abstracts and metadata information originating from the source layer. However, views can be customized beyond the source to suit the project, including restricting views to certain users or countries, styling a legend, or adding a mask.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How many datasets can I combine in one view? Is there a limit to the number of views I can display?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>Most datasets contain multiple columns of data (variables) that cannot be simultaneously viewed on a map. As a result - a “view” in MapX simply shows the visualization of one variable. It is therefore possible to have multiple views of the same data set - with each view representing a different column (variable) in the dataset. There is no limit to the number of views that can be turned on and displayed on MapX simultaneously.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="box--white">
						<h2>Story Maps</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is a story map?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>A story map is a novel way to communicate spatial data by  combining a narrative, interactive maps, photos, and videos. Story maps are a simple yet powerful way to inform, engage, and inspire your audience with any story you want to tell that can be referenced on a map. Story maps harness the power of maps by bringing data to life.</p>
									<p>The UN Biodiversity story map engine allows users and visitors of the platform to independently build  story maps without any GIS or programming  skills. Story maps can cover a wide variety of subjects and are easy to build by any user.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How can I make a story map?</a>
								<div class="slide">
									<p>We recommend storyboarding your story map before developing it on the platform. With each step you should know what the content will include: a title, text, picture, video, and/or spatial data. You should then make sure the data is available within MapX. When you have completed the storyboard, view this link <a href="https://www.mapx.org/knowledge-base/build-story-map/" title="View the guidance document on building a story map" target="_blank">here</a> for a guidance document on building your own story map.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How can I share my story map?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>You can click the sharing icon to receive a link to embed the story map into your blog, website, or online content. We are also building the ability to share on Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, Instagram and Pinterest. You can also download the story map as a video which will autoplay for offline access. A 10-slide story map will take 2-3 minutes to autoplay.</p>
								</div>

						<h2>Data Project</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is a data project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>The data project is a customizable, cloud-based private data pool in which you can create, upload, and share data with other project users. It is kept in a secure area of the website managed by UNDP and UN Environment to ensure that only users with the correct privileges can access it. Each project is managed by an administer who determines the access rights for all other users. The administrator also decides who can join the project and which data layers can be published to the project as well as publicly on MapX.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What are the functions of a data project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Beyond offering a secure data pool for you and your colleagues, creating your own project also offers a suite of additional features. In terms of analysis, you will be able to upload your own data to your project and integrate it with other datasets hosted on the platform. You will be able to customize your project and save it for access from any computer, with any bandwidth. In addition to story maps, you can also generate  customized embeddable links to your maps, which can be shared on websites and social media. You will also have the option to download story maps as videos for offline access.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What are the user privileges?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>User privileges determine who can see what data, and also what actions are available with certain datasets. There are 4 user categories. You will only be able to view or interact data that corresponds to your user category.</p>

									<ul class="bullets">
										<li class="accordion-item">Public: Unregistered users, who will have the most limited interaction with the platform. Public users are able to view “public” data only.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Users: Registered users can read views and source layers that are set for “public” and “users”. In addition, registered users can upload source layers and create views that will only be available privately or for “publishers”.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Publishers: Users with “publisher” privileges can publish source layers and views for all types of users and can edit those that are available for “public”, “user” and “publisher”.</li>
										<li class="accordion-item">Administrators: Have “publisher” privileges and can also change the status of other accounts. If you are the owner of a project, you have administrator privilege over your project. Project administrators cannot publish publicly beyond their project.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>If you are a policy maker that would like to create a national project managing data linked to a specific project or process this is also easy to do. Please contact Christina Supples (Christina.supples@undp.org), Annie Virnig (anne.virnig@undp.org) and Bianca Notarbartolo (Bianca Notarbartolo@un.org) to set-up a national project.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What if I am involved in multiple projects ? How can I access each of them?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>Many users are involved in multiple projects. This ranges from their personal project, to a project-specific project, to a national data project. When you click the My Projects button, a dropdown menu will ask you to select the project you want to enter.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">I am a public user. Can I still create a personal project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Yes! Anyone can create a project. Go through the above registration steps to receive access to your own personal project. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Can I add people to my personal project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>Yes. You can invite others via email to join your project either as readers, publishers or administrators. You will need to consider the level of access that each user should be granted as this will determine their  privileges to edit, create, delete and share whatever is in your project. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I create a project?</a>
								<div class="slide">
                  <p>In addition to joining existing national projects, listed under the ‘My Projects tab’, you can also create a personal project. While you are in the “My Projects” tab, navigate to the “Toolbox” button (with the gears). In the toolbox you will see a button that reads “Create a Project”. Here you can title your project and select “Load Project”. Important: Only projects that have been created with UNBiodiversityLab in the title, will be available within the UN Biodiversity Lab website. For example, the title of a personal project could be  ‘UNBiodiversityLab - John Personal Project.</p>
                  <p>The toolbox will now be populated with options for your project, including project configuration (title, description, map position, countries involved), define roles (administrators, publishers, members), invite members (via email input), and delete project. You can also create views in the toolbox to add to your project. When you return to the legend, you will be able to see the views you have created and style each one with an abstract, description and legend. </p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I find my project? </a>
								<div class="slide">
                  <p>Every time you access the “My Projects” tab through the UN Biodiversity Lab, you will be directed to log in via a one-use password. If you are a country administrator with a project that has been prepared for you for the Sixth National report, you can search through the list of projects that will appear and find your appropriate project. You should already be a member of the project - if you need access to your country project please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@unbiodiversitylab.org" title="Email support@unbiodiversitylab.org">support@unbiodiversitylab.org</a> or the administrator of your project. If you created a personal project, without UNBiodiversityLab in the title, you can access your project directly on the MapX website - <a href="https://mvp.app.mapx.org/">https://mvp.app.mapx.org/</a></p>

						<h2>Using and Uploading the Data</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Can I upload my own datasets?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Yes, you can upload data to your project and analyze it with the existing datasets on a global or national scale.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What data formats can I upload?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, GPX, KML. The recommended format is GeoJSON.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What if my data is in CSV or another format ?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>If your data is an a CSV or other format, you may need to use third party GIS software to convert it. We recommend an open source solution such as QGIS. If you need additional guidance on how to convert your data into a MapX compatible format, please contact support@unbiodiversitylab.org.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What format should my latitude and longitude coordinates be listed in?</a>
								<div class="slide">
									Decimal degrees.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Can my data be projected?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>No. MapX does not accept projected data. If you attempt to add projected data, you will receive a warning and the data will not upload.</p>

							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What spatial reference does UN Biodiversity Lab use?</a>
								<div class="slide">
							  	<p>WGS 84.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I upload data? </a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Once your data is in a compatible format, then select the correct spatial extent (world or country) and simply drag and drop your zipped file onto the map. You can also go to the toolbox, select “add a source” and manually upload the data. You will then have to create a view out of the dataset by clicking “upload data” after it is displayed within the view legend. After this upload is complete, you will need to complete the metadata. We suggest filling this out to the best of your ability - metadata is almost as important as the data itself! After you have completed this, click save. You will have an option to create a view immediately out of the data.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Is there a size limit for data?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Yes. The drag and drop uploading method has a 100 Mb size limit. The manual upload is 300 Mb per file. Anything larger than this will have to be ingested by our support team - contact us <a href="mailto:marion.planque@un.org" title="Contact marion.planque@un.org">here</a>.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What if my data is sensitive?</a>
								<div class="slide"><p>You can keep data in your personal project, which is secure and managed by the UN Environment and UNDP web management team. When uploading data, you will need to assign viewing rights to your data. These range from “myself” (only you), to “everyone” in the project, to “public”. These correspond to certain user privilege categories. As an administrator of a project you have complete control over who interacts with data within your project, which you can upload and control. However you will not be able to publish data publicly beyond your project. This is reserved for “publishers” who are able to view and manage public datasets. See more in the user privilege answer.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How do I edit or remove data?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>You can only edit or remove data that you have uploaded yourself. You can find the edit button in the small toolbar beneath the view title. The edit button is in the shape of a pencil, and the delete button is in the shape of a trash can.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Can I add or create graphs with the datasets? What kind of spatial statistics are available?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>You can create graphs in a dashboard using Highcharts library (https://www.highcharts.com/). The coding dashboard using Highcharts is not straightforward and requires coding skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Therefore, only users with editing rights (publishers and administrators, see user privilege question) have access to that functionality.</p>

								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How can I export a view that is visualized on my map?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>You have two options. You can either take a screenshot, which will produce a single PNG of the entire view (the menu will be invisible) and nothing else. Alternatively, you can export it as a map, which will download a zip file containing a legend, a scale, a title, a PNG picture of the map. The download will also include a PDF of the elements combined together for easy presentation.</p>

							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Can I customize my map output?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>When you export a map, the zip file will contain three PNG’s: the legend, the map, and the scale. You can customize the shape and size of your map to fit your presentation by resizing these elements. When resizing your map manually, you must resize the scale of your map as well, or inaccuracies will result.</p>
								</div>
							</li>
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">How should I cite the map?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>We recommend this format:</p>
									<p>UN Biodiversity Lab. Title [Format]. Data Date. Scale. Name of Person Who Generated Map. Name of Software. URL. (Date Accessed).</p>
									<p>Example: UN Biodiversity Lab. Mangrove Forest Soil Organic Carbon [PDF]. 2018. 1:25,000. Generated by James Bond. MapX. link to map. (19 June 2018).</p>

						<h2>Data Policy and Integrity</h2>

						<ul class="info-list accordion">
							<li class="accordion-item">
								<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">What is the data integrity seal?</a>
								<div class="slide">
								  <p>Data that meets the minimum integrity thresholds receives the data integrity seal. The integrity of each data layer is assessed using a standardized set of questions for each of the following four categories: (1) Reliability; (2) Technical Accessibility; (3) Openness; and (4) Sustainability. The level of compliance with each element of the data integrity standards is established in the course of the assessment. The results are contained within a database that is managed by UN Biodiversity Lab, together with data custodians. Following completion of the data integrity assessment, the results of the assessment are shared with the data custodians who are given the opportunity to take remedial actions to improve results prior to publication of the data sets and corresponding data integrity scores.</p>

							<li class="accordion-item">
							<a href="#" class="accordion-opener">Where does the data come from?</a>
