                  <p>The colour of the button denotes the type of data that created the view: purple for raster data and green for vector data. Vector and raster data are two fundamentally different ways of representing spatial data. Raster data is broadly thought of as data that represents things that exist on a range of values across space, such as a maps of temperature, land cover, population density, or the percent of canopy closure in a forest. The attribute of raster data is a value within a pixel (or grid cell) and can represent categorical values (such as a land cover classification) or continuous values such as elevation. In this example, the Biodiversity Intactness Index is a raster view in which every pixel has a continuous value.</p>
                  <img class="accordion__image" src="images/user-guide/data-catalogue/4.2-What-do-the-button-colours-mean.gif" alt="What do the button colors mean? GIF">
                  <p>Conversely, vector data is data that represents linear or area features on a map, such as highways (lines), cities (points), or species range maps (polygons). Vector data will normally contain not just a feature on a map, but will also have other data associated with it called attribute data. Attributes can be many things, such as place names, the area of a feature, or other calculated or derived data that is associated with a feature. In this example, for each feature in the Ecoregions2017 dataset in UN Biodiversity Lab there is an attribute for that feature’s Ecoregion (a finer scale land classification), as well as its Biome (a more generalised land classification). Try comparing two datasets, one with a purple button and one with a green button.</p>
                  <img class="accordion__image" src="images/user-guide/data-catalogue/4.3-What-do-the-button-colours-mean.png" alt="What do the button colors mean?">
                  <p>In addition, there are red buttons which denote an external geodatabase that is hosted on the UN Biodiversity Lab, such as the World Database on Protected Areas. Geodatabases are secure cloud-based spatial data containers, maintained by research institutions for spatial data that the UN Biodiversity Lab updates regularly. The World Database on Protected Areas is the largest database of legally defined protected areas on the planet. This data is updated every month.</p>

                  <p>You can use the arrows at the far left side of the View Toolbar, located beneath the legend in each view, to layer certain activated views over one another. The arrows on the far left side will move the view either to the top or the bottom of the current view legend. Use the “Filter Activated Views” button to clarify the order of your activated views.</p>

                  <p>In this example, you can see the two View Toolbars highlighted differ slightly. That is because one is a raster and one is a vector. Vector data has slightly more functions available on the platform. For example, the vector toolbar has the buttons “Zoom to selected features” and “Zoom on displayed features” . These two buttons will help you display your selected features in the frame.</p>

                  <p>The “Settings” button in the View Toolbar can be used to select a range of values to display within the iframe and/or the transparency of the view. Some vector views that include a temporal range of data can be filtered using a time-slider.</p>
                  <p>When you want to reset the settings back to nil, you can click the “reset” button.</p>

                  <p>The small <strong>i</strong> is the metadata button. This button will return information about the dataset, including the the data provider, and a link to retrieve the homepage of the source.

                  <p>You can download vector data in several different formats for use in your own programs, including ESRI shapefiles, geoJSON, and KML. Currently, raster data cannot be downloaded. You cannot download any data if you are not logged in.  If you choose to clip the data to a certain country, your file will include all data that touches the country, both within and outside the boundaries. For now, creating a true clip - or spatial intersection - of the data within your country’s borders can only be done outside UN Biodiversity Lab using GIS software (ArcMap, QGIS, OpenJump, GDAL/OGR, etc.). If you need assistance with simplifying this process, please ask for assistance by contacting the support email address (<a href="mailto:support@unbiodiversitylab.org" title="Email the support team">support@unbiodiversitylab.org</a>).</p>

                  <p>Once the download has finished, you will receive an email with a link to your data. Please note that, as some are protected under a view-only license, not all views are available for download. However, even if the data is not available to download, it is still possible to generate a map out of the view by taking a screenshot.</p>

                  <p>Making maps is a critical element of using the UN Biodiversity Lab, and it can be done in two ways. Once you have the correct view in place, click the “Take a screenshot” button to automatically begin a download of a zip file to your computer. This zip file will contain 4 elements: 3 png’s with the scale, map, and legend, and 1 PDF with all of the elements combined.</p>

You can choose which views or collections you would like to share, and whether you would like a direct link to the view within MapX, or an html code for an iframe (for a website or a blog). An iframe will essentially insert a frame into your online platform containing the view, so it can be viewed without leaving your website. You can adjust the width and height of the iframe within the code. There is also an option to tweet the view directly.</p>

To set the position of the map that your project will open to, click “Initial Map Position” and zoom in to the the chosen area and click “Use current map parameters.” You can highlight specific countries by selecting the country name(s) in the “Countries to be highlighted on the map” section. If it is not already set, this should be your 6NR country. If you would like your project to be public, check the box next to “This project is public.” This checkbox is important - it decides whether this project will be public or not. This means that your project can be searched by anyone under the “list of projects” and that views that have public access within it will be visible.</p>

Administrators have the same authority as a publisher but can also change the status of others’ accounts and delete the project entirely. We recommend that each 6NR team only have one administrator.</p>

                  <p>In order to upload your own vector data, it must be compatible with an open source format. This means it must be a ESRI Shapefile, GeoJSON, GPX, or KML file. A GeoJSON format is recommended. If you are unsure, you can see if it is compatible by using an open source software such as QGIS. ESRI Shapefiles must be zipped. Zipped files must include must include the .shp, .shx, .dbf and .prj files.</p>
                  <p>Once you are certain your data is in a compatible format, you can either upload your data by dragging and dropping if the file is less than 100 mb and a GEOJson, or manual upload if it is between 100 and 300 mb. We strongly suggest using the manual upload, as it is the most stable method of data upload.</p>

                  <p>Once your data is inside your project, you will need to style the view of your data. Note that you can only style views that you have edit access for. Styling involves selecting the attributes you want to display, choosing the colors and the legend. We will walk you through each step. The first step will be selecting the variables you want to display. Click on the pencil button do to this. The source attributes will be what is displayed on the map. Secondary source variables will be returned in a pop-up when a feature is selected by the user on the map.</p>

                  <p>The second step of styling your view is creating a legend. Click the button with a paintbrush. Each separation in your legend will be called a rule. Create one rule for each separation of your data you want to create. The value input is the <strong>starting point</strong> for the rule. Click the “Ignore missing values” button in order to remove missing values from your legend.</p>

                  <p>You can style your legend using the various size and colour options, and move the labels up or down using the arrows at the end of the row. The label is what the field will be called in the legend. Clicking preview will help you visualize how your new legend and view will look as you experiment with your legend. Click save when you are satisfied with your legend.</p>

                  <p>You can also create rules with non-numerical data. If you want to separate values based on names, you can select the value window and choose from the drop-down menu whichever value you want. In these cases, each rule will only include the value that you select. You can also enter “all” if you wish to style all of your qualitative features the same way. If your data contains a large number of unique values, the value may not show up in the dropdown, rather start typing the name of the value you would like and it will come up in dropdown.</p>
                  <p>Congratulations! You have now uploaded and styled your own data in the UN Biodiversity Lab. You can now compare it with existing data in the platform, use it in story maps, and share it with colleagues.</p>
